The tremor progressed from the left leg to involve the right leg, bilateral hands, and body (legs > hands/body).\n * Alleviating factors: The patient reported that taking an additional 0.5 tablet of Madopa alleviated the symptoms.\n * Denials: He denied fever, recent head trauma, nausea or vomiting, headache, limb weakness, numbness, diarrhea, constipation, or new medication use.\n[Focused Neurological Examination]\n * Consciousness: E4V5M6, clear.\n * Cranial Nerves:\n   * EOM: Full.\n   * Facial palsy: (-).\n   * Tongue: Mild tremor (+), no deviation.\n * Motor: upper (R/L: [5/5]), lower (R/L: [5/5]).\n * Tremor: Resting tremor noted over bilateral legs and hands.\n * Tone: No rigidity or spasticity. No active dyskinesia observed.\n * DTR: L4(R/L): [++/++].\n * Babinski sign: R/L: [down/down].\nWorkup:\n * Brain CT and Lab data were arranged to rule out intracranial hemorrhage, infection, or electrolyte/metabolic imbalance.\nImpression:\nParkinson's disease with acute worsening of resting tremor.\nRule out metabolic encephalopathy or electrolyte imbalance.\nSuggestion:\nWait for Lab and CT results to exclude acute medical causes (infection/ICH/metabolic).\nIf acute medical causes are excluded, consider adjustment of anti-Parkinson agents.\nWe have explained the clinical course to the family and the patient, please keep f/u clinical symptoms and signs.\nSuggest Neurology OPD follow up.\nResident S-H Wang (#2545)"
